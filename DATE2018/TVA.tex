\section{FURTHER OPTIMIZATION BY V\textsubscript{TH} ASSIGNMENT}
\label{sec:TVA}
% (1)
In the section, V\textsubscript{th} assignment and aging manipulation are applied together to further optimize the required $T_c$. In addition to aging manipulation based on DCC insertion/deployment, we re-assign the threshold voltage of certain clock buffers, such that the latencies of the buffers are changed, so are the slacks, which give us the opportunity to further mitigate the aging-induced degradation of logic network based on timing borrowing. The section is organized as follows:  We use the circuit in Figure~\ref{fig:sub:example} to demonstrate the results when V\textsubscript{th} assignment is applied. 2) Technology leader: In order to simplify the complexity of SAT formulation when V\textsubscript{th} assignment is considered, we introduce a mechanism/rule of V\textsubscript{th} assignment.
